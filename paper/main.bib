	abstract = {Experience from seven decades of classical computing suggests that a sustainable computer industry depends on a community of software engineers writing programs to address a wide variety of specific end-user needs, achieving both performance and utility in the process. Quantum computing is an emerging technology, and we do not yet have the insight to understand what quantum software tools and practices will best support researchers, software engineers, or applications specialists. Developers for today's quantum computers are grappling with the low-level details of the hardware, and progress towards scalable devices does not yet suggest what higher-level abstractions may look like. In this paper, we analyze and reframe the current state of the quantum software stack using the language of programming models. We propose an abstraction hierarchy to support quantum software engineering and discuss the consequences of overlaps across the programming, execution, and hardware models found in current technologies. We exercise this hierarchy for solving the eigenvalue estimation problem in two ways (a variational algorithm with error mitigation, and phase estimation with error correction) and pinpoint key differences in these approaches in terms of these layered models and their overlaps. While our work points to concrete conceptual challenges and gaps in quantum programming and proposes some specific steps forward, our primary thesis is that progress hinges on thinking about the abstraction hierarchy holistically, and not just about its components.},

We provide an overview of current projects in the OQH ecosystem, identify gaps, and make recommendations on how to close them today.

Version 3.0 which adds timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers is currently undergoing finalization in 2023 [CJA+21]. In a similar vein, Pakin of Los Alamos National Laboratory published a quantum macro assembler (QMASM) for D-Wave quantum annealers in 2016 [Pak16]. This assembler specifically targets quantum annealers like D-Wave's. A comparable technology that targets continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is the Blackbird language developed by Xanadu since 2018 [KIQ+19]. We implement parsers for each of these languages in TypeScript with a singular approach. In the cases of Blackbird and QMASM these are the first parser implementations that are web compatible and so bring these languages to a new audience and to new runtimes. This makes the parsing and execution of QMASM, QASM and Blackbird possible in web and mobile environments that don't have access to heavy compile toolchains, enabling adoption and scientific research.},

            Quantum software—like classic software—needs to be designed, specified, developed, and, most importantly, tested by developers. Writing tests is a complex, error-prone, and time-consuming task. Due to the particular properties of quantum physics (e.g., superposition), quantum software is inherently more complex to develop and effectively test than classical software. Nevertheless, some preliminary works have tried to bring commonly used classical testing practices for quantum computing to assess and improve the quality of quantum programs. In this chapter, we first gather 16 quantum software testing techniques that have been proposed for the IBM quantum framework, Qiskit. Then, whenever possible, we illustrate the usage of each technique (through the proposed tool that implements it, if available) on a given running example. We showcase that although several works have been proposed to ease the burn of testing quantum software, we are still in the early stages of testing in the quantum world. Researchers should focus on delivering artifacts that are usable without much hindrance to the rest of the community, and the development of quantum benchmarks should be a priority to facilitate reproducibility, replicability, and comparison between different testing techniques.},

This paper presents QChecker, a static analysis tool that supports finding bugs in quantum programs in Qiskit. QChecker consists of two main modules: a module for extracting program information based on abstract syntax tree (AST), and a module for detecting bugs based on patterns. We evaluate the performance of QChecker using the Bugs4Q benchmark. The evaluation results show that QChecker can effectively detect various bugs in quantum programs.},
